      <p>Use this page to help find diverse books! I tried to mention the different types of representation for each book but I may have missed some because I'm only one person so I apologize in advance. Also, I realize that there are so many different kinds of representation however I had to limit it to a few of the major ones. Each filter will show a variety of books but some books will show up in more than one category. Happy reading!</p>

            <p>Felix Love has never been in love—and, yes, he’s painfully aware of the irony. He desperately wants to know what it’s like and why it seems 
              so easy for everyone but him to find someone. What’s worse is that, even though he is proud of his identity, Felix also secretly fears that 
              he’s one marginalization too many—Black, queer, and transgender—to ever get his own happily-ever-after. When an anonymous student begins 
              sending him transphobic messages—after publicly posting Felix’s deadname alongside images of him before he transitioned—Felix comes up 
              with a plan for revenge. What he didn’t count on: his catfish scenario landing him in a quasi–love triangle.... But as he navigates his 
              complicated feelings, Felix begins a journey of questioning and self-discovery that helps redefine his most important relationship:
               how he feels about himself. Felix Ever After is an honest and layered story about identity, falling in love, and recognizing the love you deserve.

            <p>Maia Tamarin dreams of becoming the greatest tailor in the land, but as a girl, the best she can hope for is to marry well. When a 
              royal messenger summons her ailing father, once a tailor of renown, to court, Maia poses as a boy and takes his place. She knows her 
              life is forfeit if her secret is discovered, but she'll take that risk to achieve her dream and save her family from ruin. 
              There's just one catch: Maia is one of twelve tailors vying for the job.
              Backstabbing and lies run rampant as the tailors compete in challenges to prove their artistry and skill. Maia's task is further 
              complicated when she draws the attention of the court magician, Edan, whose piercing eyes seem to see straight through her disguise.
              And nothing could have prepared her for the final challenge: to sew three magic gowns for the emperor's reluctant bride-to-be, from 
              the laughter of the sun, the tears of the moon, and the blood of stars. With this impossible task before her, she embarks on a journey 
              to the far reaches of the kingdom, seeking the sun, the moon, and the stars, and finding more than she ever could have imagined.

                 gripping debut of discovery, conquering fear, and taking identity into your own hands.

              while many of the children who survived were left with strange markings. Adelina’s black hair turned silver, her lashes went pale, and now she 
              has only a jagged scar where her left eye once was. Her cruel father believes she is a malfetto, an abomination, ruining their family’s good 
              name and standing in the way of their fortune. But some of the fever’s survivors are rumored to possess more than just scars—they are believed 
              to have mysterious and powerful gifts, and though their identities remain secret, they have come to be called the Young Elites. Teren Santoro 
              works for the king. As Leader of the Inquisition Axis, it is his job to seek out the Young Elites, to destroy them before they destroy the nation. 
              He believes the Young Elites to be dangerous and vengeful, but it’s Teren who may possess the darkest secret of all. Enzo Valenciano is a member 
              of the Dagger Society. This secret sect of Young Elites seeks out others like them before the Inquisition Axis can. But when the Daggers find 
              Adelina, they discover someone with powers like they’ve never seen. Adelina wants to believe Enzo is on her side, and that Teren is the true enemy.
               But the lives of these three will collide in unexpected ways, as each fights a very different and personal battle. But of one thing they are all 
               certain: Adelina has abilities that shouldn’t belong in this world. A vengeful blackness in her heart. And a desire to destroy all who dare to

              Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more...? Charlie Spring is in Year 10 at Truham Grammar School for Boys. The past year 
              hasn't been too great, but at least he's not being bullied anymore. Nick Nelson is in Year 11 and on the school rugby team. He's heard a little 
              about Charlie - the kid who was outed last year and bullied for a few months - but he's never had the opportunity to talk to him. They quickly 
              become friends, and soon Charlie is falling hard for Nick, even though he doesn't think he has a chance. But love works in surprising ways, and 
              sometimes good things are waiting just around the corner... </p>

            <p>Henry “Monty” Montague was born and bred to be a gentleman, but he was never one to be tamed. The finest boarding schools in England and the 
              constant disapproval of his father haven’t been able to curb any of his roguish passions—not for gambling halls, late nights spent with a 
              bottle of spirits, or waking up in the arms of women or men. But as Monty embarks on his Grand Tour of Europe, his quest for a life filled with 
              pleasure and vice is in danger of coming to an end. Not only does his father expect him to take over the family’s estate upon his return, but 
              Monty is also nursing an impossible crush on his best friend and traveling companion, Percy. Still it isn’t in Monty’s nature to give up. Even 
              with his younger sister, Felicity, in tow, he vows to make this year long escapade one last hedonistic hurrah and flirt with Percy from Paris 
              to Rome. But when one of Monty’s reckless decisions turns their trip abroad into a harrowing manhunt that spans across Europe, it calls into 
              question everything he knows, including his relationship with the boy he adores.</p>

            <p>Each year, eight beautiful girls are chosen as Paper Girls to serve the king. It's the highest honor they could hope for...and the most demeaning.
               This year, there's a ninth. And instead of paper, she's made of fire. In this richly developed fantasy, Lei is a member of the Paper caste, 
               the lowest and most persecuted class of people in Ikhara. She lives in a remote village with her father, where the decade-old trauma of watching
                her mother snatched by royal guards for an unknown fate still haunts her. Now, the guards are back and this time it's Lei they're after -- 
                the girl with the golden eyes whose rumored beauty has piqued the king's interest. Over weeks of training in the opulent but oppressive palace,
                 Lei and eight other girls learn the skills and charm that befit a king's consort. There, she does the unthinkable -- she falls in love. Her 
                 forbidden romance becomes enmeshed with an explosive plot that threatens her world's entire way of life. Lei, still the wide-eyed country girl 
                 at heart, must decide how far she's willing to go for justice and revenge.</p>

               that sometimes, best friends don't have to talk. Darius has never had a true friend before, but now he's spending his days with Sohrab playing 
               soccer, eating rosewater ice cream, and sitting together for hours in their special place, a rooftop overlooking the Yazdi skyline. Sohrab calls 
               him Darioush—the original Persian version of his name—and Darius has never felt more like himself than he does now that he's Darioush to Sohrab.
                When it's time to go home to America, he'll have to find a way to be Darioush on his own.</p>

            <p>Chloe Brown is a chronically ill computer geek with a goal, a plan, and a list. After almost—but not quite—dying, she’s come up with seven directives 
              to help her “Get a Life”, and she’s already completed the first: finally moving out of her glamorous family’s mansion. The next items?
              • Enjoy a drunken night out.
              • Ride a motorcycle.
              • Go camping.
              • Have meaningless but thoroughly enjoyable sex.
              • Travel the world with nothing but hand luggage.
              • And... do something bad.
              But it’s not easy being bad, even when you’ve written step-by-step guidelines on how to do it correctly. What Chloe needs is a teacher, and she knows 
              just the man for the job. Redford ‘Red’ Morgan is a handyman with tattoos, a motorcycle, and more sex appeal than ten-thousand Hollywood heartthrobs. 
              He’s also an artist who paints at night and hides his work in the light of day, which Chloe knows because she spies on him occasionally. Just the teeniest, 
              tiniest bit. But when she enlists Red in her mission to rebel, she learns things about him that no spy session could teach her. Like why he clearly resents 
              Chloe’s wealthy background. And why he never shows his art to anyone. And what really lies beneath his rough exterior…

               broken heart. Like the rest of America, Bea indulges in her weekly obsession: the hit reality show Main Squeeze. The fantasy dates! The kiss-off rejections! 
               The surprising amount of guys named Chad! But Bea is sick and tired of the lack of body diversity on the show. Since when is being a size zero a prerequisite 
               for getting engaged on television? Just when Bea has sworn off dating altogether, she gets an intriguing call: Main Squeeze wants her to be its next star, 
               surrounded by men vying for her affections. Bea agrees, on one condition--under no circumstances will she actually fall in love. She's in this to supercharge 
               her career, subvert harmful anti-fat beauty standards, inspire women across America, and get a free hot air balloon ride. That's it.But when the cameras 
               start rolling, Bea realizes things are more complicated than she anticipated. She's in a whirlwind of sumptuous couture, Internet culture wars, sexy suitors, 
               and an opportunity (or two, or five) to find messy, real-life love in the midst of a made-for-TV fairy tale. In this joyful, razor-sharp debut, Bea has to 
               decide whether it might just be worth trusting these men--and herself--for a chance to live happily ever after.</p>

            <p>Marcus Caster-Rupp has a secret. While the world knows him as Aeneas, the star of the biggest show on TV, Gods of the Gates, he's known to 
              fanfiction readers as Book!AeneasWouldNever, an anonymous and popular poster.  Marcus is able to get out his own frustrations with his character
              through his stories, especially the ones that feature the internet’s favorite couple to ship, Aeneas and Lavinia. But if anyone ever found out 
              about his online persona, he’d be fired. Immediately. April Whittier has secrets of her own. A hardcore Lavinia fan, she’s hidden her fanfiction 
              and cosplay hobby from her “real life” for years—but not anymore. When she decides to post her latest Lavinia creation on Twitter, her photo goes 
              viral. Trolls and supporters alike are commenting on her plus-size take, but when Marcus, one half of her OTP, sees her pic and asks her out on a 
              date to spite her critics, she realizes life is really stranger than fanfiction. Even though their first date is a disaster, Marcus quickly realizes 
              that he wants much more from April than a one-time publicity stunt. And when he discovers she’s actually Unapologetic Lavinia Stan, his closest fandom 
              friend, he has one more huge secret to hide from her. With love and Marcus’s career on the line, can the two of them stop hiding once and for all, or 
              will a match made in fandom end up prematurely cancelled?</p>

            <p>Skye Shin has heard it all. Fat girls shouldn’t dance. Wear bright colors. Shouldn’t call attention to themselves. But Skye dreams of joining 
              the glittering world of K-Pop, and to do that, she’s about to break all the rules that society, the media, and even her own mother, have set 
              for girls like her. She’ll challenge thousands of other performers in an internationally televised competition looking for the next K-pop star, 
              and she’ll do it better than anyone else. When Skye nails her audition, she’s immediately swept into a whirlwind of countless practices, 
              shocking performances, and the drama that comes with reality TV. What she doesn’t count on are the highly fat-phobic beauty standards of the Korean 
              pop entertainment industry, her sudden media fame and scrutiny, or the sparks that soon fly with her fellow competitor, Henry Cho. But Skye has 
              her sights on becoming the world’s first plus-sized K-pop star, and that means winning the competition—without losing herself.</p>

            <p>You know all those movies where teenagers have, like, THE SUMMER OF THEIR LIVES? This summer is probably not going to be that. Source: Everything that's happened since yesterday ...
              The last thing sixteen-year-old Maisie Martin thought she'd be doing this summer is entering a beauty pageant. Not when she's spent most of her life hiding her body from everyone. 
              Not when her Dad is AWOL for Christmas and her gorgeous older sister has returned to rock Maisie's shaky confidence. And her best friend starts going out with the boy she's always loved. 
              But Maisie's got something to prove. As she writes down all the ways this summer is going from bad to worse in her school-assignment journal, what starts as a homework torture-device might 
              just end up being an account of how Maisie didn't let anything, or anyone, hold her back... </p>
